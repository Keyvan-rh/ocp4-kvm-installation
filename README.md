# ocp4-kvm-installation
There are set of script that would help build an OCP 4 on kvm/libvert  
The original script and work is done by Christian.H at this link:
https://github.com/christianh814/ocp4-upi-helpernode
I have done the folowing:

    1. Created scripts for steps that Christian.H has describe in his repo. 
    
    2. Added the mac address to my scripts so I don't need to update the vars.yaml with mac address every time.
    
    3. As the network was not accessable from my other machines in the network I used the bridge instead of network.
